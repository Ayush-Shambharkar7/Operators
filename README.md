# Operators

### Experiment 3

**Aim -** 
Performing Arithematic Operations using C++ Operators.

## Theory
Arithmetic operators are symbols used in CPP programming to perform arithematic operations on variables and their values. They are important to writing expressions and making decisions in code.

### Types: 
Addition (+): Adds two operands.
Example: a + b
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
Example: a - b
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
Example: a * b
Division (/): Divides the numerator by the denominator.
Example: a / b
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division operation.
Example: a % b

## Algorithm 

1. **Start**

2. **Input**
   - Prompt user to enter integer `a`.
   - Read `a` from user.
   - Prompt user to enter integer `b`.
   - Read `b` from user.

3. **Calculate**
   - Compute `sum = a + b`.
   - Compute `sub = a - b`.
   - Compute `prdt = a * b`.
   - Compute `div = a / b`.

4. **Output**
   - Display `sum`.
   - Display `sub`.
   - Display `prdt`.
   - Display `div`.

5. **End**
